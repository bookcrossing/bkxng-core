# Safe Zones

## I see a list of books on the site. Where can I get them to read?

Pay attention to the status of the book. If the book has the status "traveling", this means that it should be searched in the place that the user specified when it was released. If a book has a "found" status, it means that someone is already reading the book and you should wait until it is released again, or contact the reader directly through their Facebook profile to speed up the process.

## What is a safe zone?

Our world does not yet look like a large library, so books here may disappear or fall into the wrong hands. Safe zones are places where your book will be taken care of and will do whatever it takes to get it to the next reader.

## How do I add a safe zone?

If you have organized a safe zone, or know where a similar place is in your city, we can add it to our list of safe zones \(maybe your safe zone is already there?\). To do this, you need:

* Release the book and leave it on the shelf;
* Copy the URL link to the place where you left the book;
* Send the copied URL to safezones@bookcrossing.by;
* In your email, also indicate the address of the shelf, on what days and at what time it is available.

## How can I add my city if it is not in the list?

If you try to release a book, but your city is not in the list, then you can easily add it. To do this, select a country, and select "Unknown" as the city \(at the very end of the list\). And then specify the name of the desired city and the name of the place separated by commas as the place.

_Example:_ Country - Belarus; City - Unknown; Location - New Vasyuki, Amateur Chess Club

If the country you need was not in the list either, then you can add it in the same way: select "Unknown" as the country, "Unknown" as the city, and in the description of the place specify the Country, City and the actual place where you are going to release the book.

_Example:_ Country - Unknown; City - Unknown; Place - Kalmykia, New-Vasyuki, Amateur chess club
