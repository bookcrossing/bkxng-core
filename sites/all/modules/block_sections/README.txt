============

Block Sections is a module for Drupal 7 that allows blocks to display different
content depending the current path. This way there is no need for creating
multiple custom blocks in order to vary the content of them.


INSTALLATION
============

Just enable the module as usual.


USAGE
============

Add sections in admin/structure/block-sections.
Add section blocks in admin/structure/block ("Add section block" link).
In the block configuration there is a content field for every section added in
step 2.
