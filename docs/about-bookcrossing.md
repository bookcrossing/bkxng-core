# About BookCrossing

## What is BookCrossing?

Imagine that the whole world has become a large public library, subject to one rule - to give people free access to books. Then any place \(park, cafe, subway, bus, bench in the garden, ...\) will be a bookshelf where readers bring books after reading. You can come at a convenient time and take the book you like.

Book–°rossing \(literally "transition of a book" \[from one reader to another\]\) aims to give books freedom from the bonds of your bookcase and start their journey around the world so that books can bring joy to new and new readers.

## What is BCID?

Bookcrossing ID \(BCID\) is a unique identifier for a book. It is assigned to every book released. 

The BCID must be written on the flyleaf of the book so that the next reader can follow the book's journey and comment on the book in its history.

## How do I get involved?

You can just leave books in public places. But to help other people find them, you need to point out where you left the book. After registering on the site, you will have the opportunity to receive a unique number \(BCID\) for each book that you release. You will be able to point out where you left the book, and then find out and meet people who found and read your book.
