# Registration & Sign In

## How to register?

The site does not have its own registration. In order to enter / authorize on the site, it is enough to have an account on Facebook or VK. To sign in, use the link located in the upper left corner of the page.

## Why is there no way to register using username and password?

We want to make the website easier to use. Both for users and for ourselves. Even if you use a password manager, it's still incredibly difficult to store passwords for the hundreds of sites you visit.

On the other hand, keeping passwords is a big responsibility. We believe that the fewer places where your valuable personal data is stored, the better; moreover, most users use the same passwords on several services.

We also chose Facebook and VK because we and our users do not need to spend time creating an additional profile and keeping it up to date.

We hope you agree with us and support our decision.
