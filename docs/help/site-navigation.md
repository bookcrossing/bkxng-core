## Book Catalog

The catalog is the heart of the site. You will find there all the books that have ever been registered and released. You can search for books in the catalog by title, author, genre, or place where the book was released.

You can view books as tiles with additional information or as covers.

If you want to reduce the search area, use the tag cloud at the bottom of the page.

Experiment with combinations of sorting \(title, author, genre, location\) and filtering by tags. The results are often interesting.
